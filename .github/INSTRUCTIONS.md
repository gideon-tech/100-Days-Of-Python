# Daily Project Setup Instructions 📋

## For Each New Day's Project

### 1. Create Project Directory
Create a new directory with the format: `Day X Project: [Project Name]`

Example:
```bash
mkdir "Day 3 Project: Treasure Island"
```

### 2. Create Your Code File
Create `main.py` inside the project directory:
```bash
touch "Day 3 Project: Treasure Island/main.py"
```

### 3. Create README from Template
Copy the template and fill it out:
```bash
cp .github/DAILY_PROJECT_TEMPLATE.md "Day 3 Project: Treasure Island/README.md"
```

Then edit the README with:
- Project name and emoji
- Description of what you built
- What you learned
- Usage examples
- Any challenges you faced

### 4. Update Main Repository README
Update `/README.md`:
- Add your project to the progress tracker table
- Update the current day counter
- Update your streak

### Quick Template Sections

**Project Description:** 1-2 sentences about what the project does

**What I Learned:** 3-5 bullet points of new concepts/skills

**Features:** List the main functionality

**Challenges Faced:** What problems did you encounter and how did you solve them?

**Code Highlights:** Share interesting or clever code snippets

## Naming Conventions

- **Directory:** `Day X Project: [Project Name]` (with spaces)
- **Main file:** `main.py`
- **README:** `README.md` in each project directory

## Tips

- Document your learning immediately after completing the project
- Include code examples that demonstrate what you learned
- Be honest about challenges - they show growth!
- Add emojis to make it fun 🎉
